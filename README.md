# OpenGLExperiments
Some OpenGL experiments following [this tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3gAzLwfIP0&list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2&index=1) in preparation for shaders in the Mimic Game Engine! This commit just finished [Setting up a Test Framework for OpenGL](https://youtu.be/A_hS4_r5KcA?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2). This branch is for the homework from this video. It will set up test scenes for multiple different portions of the things learned so far.
