# OpenGLExperiments
Some OpenGL experiments following [this tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3gAzLwfIP0&list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2&index=1) in preparation for shaders in the Mimic Game Engine! This commit just finished [Textures in OpenGL](https://youtu.be/n4k7ANAFsIQ?si=S7DZzDqTWo5mASUa). The readme will be updated as progress is made. This currently only supports x86, do not compile for x64.
