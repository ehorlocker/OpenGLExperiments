# OpenGLExperiments
Some OpenGL experiments following [this tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3gAzLwfIP0&list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2&index=1) in preparation for shaders in the Mimic Game Engine! This branch just finished [Vertex Arrays in OpenGL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bcs56Mm-FJY&list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2&index=12). There's some abstraction stuff coming after this so I wanted to keep an earlier example of the code as a basis.
